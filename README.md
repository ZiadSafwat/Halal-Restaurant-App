# Restaurant App 🍽️📱

Hi there! 👋

As I'm currently looking for new opportunities, I decided to level up my CV with a strong personal project.  
I'm currently working on a **restaurant application** with a slightly different concept — aiming to improve both the **restaurant owner's experience** and the **customer's journey**.

## What's Inside? 🧠✨

### For Restaurant Owners 🧑‍🍳
- Add custom **ingredients** (like vegetables, meats, etc.) 🥩🥦
- Create **dishes** linked to those ingredients with:
  - Descriptions 📝
  - Prices 💰
  - Ratings ⭐
  - Purchase counts 🔢
  - Images 🖼️
- Combine dishes into **meals** (like a Family Meal Deal 🍛) and apply dynamic **discounts** 🏷️
- The backend calculates total price + discount and sends the result to the app ⚙️

All of this is managed smoothly through an **admin panel** for full control ⚡

### For Customers 👥
- Browse the food menu quickly and effortlessly ⚡
- View ingredients of each dish 📋
- Tap on an ingredient to explore all dishes made with it 🔍
- Get prices and product details at a glance 💡
- Enjoy a modern, responsive UX for a seamless experience 🧑‍💻

## Tech Stack 💻🛠️

- **Flutter** for the frontend  
- **PocketBase** as a lightweight and fast backend

## Not Just Another Restaurant App… 🚀

This isn't just a food delivery app. It's a complete experience that simplifies decision-making for customers and provides powerful tools for restaurant owners to manage orders and engage with users.

Still working on it — but here's a sneak peek of the journey so far. More to come!
## Installation

### Set Up the Backend

Ensure that your system meets the requirements for PocketBase  this project contain both linux and windows version if you want to run backend just extract (uncompress) the backend.zip file then go to the backend folder from this repo then run this command .

1. run backend command:

    ```bash
    ./pocketbase serve --http="0.0.0.0:8090"
    ```

    This will start the pocketbase server on **port 8090** this is the port configured for the frontend app if you want to change the mobile app default server link change it in the lib/Core/Const/constant.dart file.
